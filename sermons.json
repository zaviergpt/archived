Honour is the mark of a Christian\n> John 13:34-34 NLT\nWhen you grow in Christ, the way we see people change = the way we treat people change\nThe world seems to know the mark of a Christian by what we are against.\nHow about people knowing the mark of a Christian by what we are for?\nDo people know what you are a believer by what you are against, or what you are for?\n\n# 2. Honour chooses to say no one is ordinary\n> Mark 10:13-16 NLT\nHonour can be displayed in action, words or even thoughts. But true honour starts from the heart.\n> Isaiah 29:13 NIV\n## John Bevere - The real question\nNot - Am I honouring others?\nBut - Am I treating others as common/ordinary?`\n## C.S Lewis, The Weight of Glory\n`There are no ordinary people. You have never talked to a mere mortal.`\n\n# 3. Honour brings people closer to what God is doing\n## John Bevere\n`..show me a person who has no regard for authority and I will show you a person who is not a child of God. When you meet God, you meet authority, because God and His authority are inseparable.`\n> Mark 6:1-5 NLT\nWe restrain ourselves from what God is doing when we choose not to honour.\nTo the world: Dishonour is humiliation, rejection\nTo Jesus: Dishonour is treating as ordinary, common"

We believe the main problem is in the software (internal).\nYou may be afraid to say because you think that people will think that you are crazy.\nIf you hear tormenting voices in your head or feel a dark presence in your room at night - you're not crazy, you're not alone!\n47 percent of American students said so too!\nMany Christians don't complain about hearing voices, but their minds are filled with such confusion that their walk with Christ is completely discouraging.\n\n# Has this happened before?\n- When you try to pray, you begin thinking about a million things you should be doing.\n- When you sit down to read the bible or a good Christian book, you can't concentrate.\n- When you have an opportunity to serve in some way, you give up because of thoughts of self-doubt: \"I'm not a strong Christian\"; \"I don't know enough about the Bible\"; \"I'm too young\"; \"I have too many sinful thoughts\"; \"My ability is not there\"; \"I will be judged\".\n- When you run to God again, you think \"I will give up anyway again\".\n- When you are able to get help or go to church \"Don't go, they can't help you\" or distracting thoughts will come \"I tried this before and it didn't work\"; \"I don't want to go\".\nSome of this discouragement is because of our own faulty thinking, but it can also reflect deception from the enemy.\n> Ephesians 6:12 NLT\nWe all need a revelation (realisation by the holy spirit) of the areas we are held bondage to.\nBondage = Restraining, tying, trapping you so that you are a slave.\n> John 8:34-36 NLT\n\n# A Lost Sheep\n`Dear God, where are you? How can you watch and not help me? I hurt so bad, and you don't even care. If you cared you'd make it stop or let me die. I love you, but you seem so far away. I can't hear you or feel you or see you, but I'm supposed to believe you're here. Lord, I feel them and hear them. They are here. I know you're real, God, but they are more real to me right now. Please make someone believe me, Lord. Why won't you make it stop? Please, Lord, please! If you love me you'll let me die.`"
